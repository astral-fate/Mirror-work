                        <h3>Your Day 1 Mirror Work Exercise</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stand or sit in front of your bathroom mirror.</li>
                            <li>Look into your eyes.</li>
                            <li>Take a deep breath and say this affirmation: <em>I want to like you. I want to really learn to love you. Let’s go for it and really have some fun.</em></li>
                            <li>Take another deep breath and say, <em>I’m learning to really like you. I’m learning to really love you.</em></li>
                            <li>This is the first exercise, and I know it can be a little challenging, but please stay with it. Keep taking deep breaths. Look into your eyes. Use your own name as you say, <em>I’m willing to learn to love you, [Name]. I’m willing to learn to love you.</em></li>
                            <li>Throughout the day, each time you pass a mirror or see your reflection, please repeat these affirmations, even if you have to do it silently.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>At first when you do your mirror work, you may feel silly or stupid repeating the affirmations. You may even be angry or want to cry. That’s all right—in fact, it’s quite normal. And you’re not alone. Remember that I’m right here with you. I’ve been through this, too. And tomorrow is a new day.</em></p>

                        <h3>The Power Is Within You: Your Day 1 Journaling Exercise</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>After you finish your morning mirror work, write down your feelings and observations. Did you feel angry or upset or silly?</li>
                            <li>Six hours after finishing your morning mirror work, again write down your feelings and observations. As you continued to practice your mirror work formally and informally, did you start to believe what you were saying to yourself?</li>
                            <li>Keep track of any changes in your behavior or your beliefs over the course of the day. Did the exercise get easier, or did you continue to find it difficult after doing it awhile?</li>
                            <li>At the end of the day, before you go to bed, write down what you learned from doing your mirror work.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 1: I Am Open and Receptive</h3>
                        <p>If we do mirror work to create good in our lives but there’s a part of us that doesn’t believe we are worth it, we are not going to believe the words we are saying as we look in the mirror. We will reach a point at which we start thinking, <em>Mirror work doesn’t work.</em></p>
                        <p>The truth is, the perception that mirror work doesn’t work has nothing to do with the mirror work itself or the affirmations we say. The problem is that we don’t believe we deserve all the good that life has to offer.</p>
                        <p>If that’s your belief, then affirm: <em>I am open and receptive.</em></p>

                <!-- Day 2 -->

                    <div class="day-content">
                        <h3>Your Day 2 Mirror Work Exercise</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stand in front of your bathroom mirror.</li>
                            <li>Look into your eyes.</li>
                            <li>Using your name, say this affirmation: <em>[Name], I love you. I really, really love you.</em></li>
                            <li>Take a few moments now to say it two or three more times: <em>I really, really love you, [Name].</em></li>
                            <li>Keep repeating this affirmation over and over. I want you to be able to say it at least 100 times a day. Yes, that’s right: 100 times a day. I know that seems like a lot, but honestly, 100 times a day is easy once you get into the swing of it.</li>
                            <li>So each time you pass a mirror or see your reflection just repeat this affirmation: <em>[Name], I love you. I really, really love you.</em></li>
                        </ol>
                         <p><em>When you find it difficult to tell yourself I love you, it is most likely because you are judging yourself, repeating those old, negative messages. Don’t add to your discomfort by judging yourself for making judgments. Just relax and commit to saying the affirmation. Remember: you are committing to an affirmation that’s true. The truth is, we do love ourselves, when we are not judging ourselves.</em></p>

                        <h3>The Power Is Within You: Your Day 2 Journaling Exercise</h3>
                        <p>Life is very simple. What we give out, we get back. In your journal, write down your responses to the following questions:</p>
                        <ol>
                             <li>What do you want that you are not getting?</li>
                             <li>When you were growing up, what were the rules about deserving? Did you always have to earn in order to deserve? Were things taken away from you when you did something wrong?</li>
                             <li>Do you feel that you deserve to live? To have joy? If not, why not?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>As you answer these questions, notice the emotions you are feeling. Write them down in your journal.</em></p>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 2: I Am Deserving</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes we refuse to put any effort into creating a good life for ourselves because we believe that we don’t deserve it. The belief that we don’t deserve it may come from our early-childhood experiences. We might be buying into someone else’s concept or opinion that has nothing to do with our own reality.</p>
                        <p>Deserving has nothing to do with being good. It is our unwillingness to receive the good in life that gets in the way. Allow yourself to accept the good, whether you think you deserve it or not.</p>

                            <li>Stand or sit in front of your bathroom mirror.</li>
                            <li>Look into your eyes.</li>
                            <li>Say this affirmation: <em>Whatever I say to myself, I will say it with love.</em></li>
                            <li>Keep repeating it: <em>Whatever I say to myself in this mirror, I will say it with love.</em></li>
                            <li>Is there a statement that you heard as a child that still sticks in your head? Maybe something like “You’re stupid” or “You’re not good enough,” or whatever else comes to mind. Take time to work with negative statements and turn them into positive affirmations: <em>I am smart. I am more intelligent than I realize. I am a genius with an abundance of creative ideas. I am a magnificent person. I am lovable. I am worth loving.</em></li>
                            <li>Choose one or two of these new, positive affirmations and say them over and over again. Keep saying them until you feel comfortable with them.</li>
                            <li>Each time you pass a mirror or see your reflection in a window throughout the day, stop and repeat these loving affirmations.</li>

                        <h3>The Power Is Within You: Your Day 3 Journaling Exercise</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Did you repeat a negative story today? Write down how many times you repeated it and how many people you told it to. Now write down something positive you can tell those people tomorrow that will help them feel better about themselves and everyone around them.</li>
                            <li>Write down the word <em>should</em>. Next to it, make a list of words to use instead. You might start with the word <em>could</em>.</li>
                            <li>Post several of the new, positive affirmations you learned today on your mirror so you can practice them whenever you see them.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 3: I Always Have a Choice</h3>
                        <p>Most of us have foolish ideas about who we are and many rigid rules about how life should be lived. Let’s remove the word <em>should</em> from our vocabulary forever. <em>Should</em> is a word that makes prisoners of us. Every time we use <em>should</em>, we are making ourselves wrong or someone else wrong. We are, in effect, saying: <em>not good enough</em>.</p>
                        <p>What can be dropped now from your <em>should</em> list? Replace the word <em>should</em> with the word <em>could</em>. <em>Could</em> lets you know that you have a choice, and choice is freedom. We need to be aware that everything we do in life is done by choice. There is really nothing we <em>have</em> to do. We always have a choice.</p>

                            <li>Look at your forehead and imagine that you are pressing a button that ejects a disk of all the old beliefs and negative thoughts that have been playing in your head. Reach up and imagine that you are pulling this recording out of your head and throwing it away.</li>
                            <li>Now look deeply into your eyes and tell yourself, <em>Let’s make a new recording of positive beliefs and affirmations.</em></li>
                            <li>Say these affirmations aloud: <em>I am willing to let go. I release. I let go. I release all tension. I release all fear. I release all anger. I release all guilt. I release all sadness. I let go of old limitations and beliefs. I let go, and I am at peace. I am at peace with myself. I am at peace with the process of life. I am safe.</em></li>

                            <li>Throughout the day, whenever any difficult thoughts arise, take out your pocket mirror and repeat these affirmations. Become familiar with them so that repeating them becomes a part of your daily routine.</li>

                            <li>I find that most of the problems in our lives are caused by what I call the Big Four: Criticism, Fear, Guilt, and Resentment. In your journal, create four columns, heading each with one of the Big Four categories. Think about what role they play in your life. Write your thoughts and feelings about each category in the appropriate column.</li>
                            <li>From Step 1, take the two categories you wrote the most about and write down ten positive affirmations in each category. For example, if one of the categories is Resentment, you might write affirmations like <em>I now choose to release all hurt and resentment. The more resentment I release, the more love I have to give.</em></li>
                            <li>Everything in our lives is a mirror of who we are. Think of the people in your life who are the most challenging for you. What are the traits that bother you most about them? Write those down.</li>
                            <li>Look at the traits that you listed in Step 3. Write down how each of these traits mirrors a belief that you have about yourself. You might also want to jot down what you have learned about yourself in doing today’s exercises.</li>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 4: I Can Let Go</h3>
                         <p>We create habits and patterns because they serve us in some way. It is amazing how many illnesses we create because we want to punish a parent. We may not be doing this consciously—in fact, in most cases it is not conscious. But when we start looking within, we find the pattern. We often create negativity because we do not know how to handle some area of life. If that’s the case, ask yourself: <em>What am I feeling sorry about? Who am I angry at? What am I trying to avoid? How do I think this will this save me?</em></p>
                         <p>If you are not ready to let something go—you really want to hold on to it because it serves you—it doesn’t matter what you do; you will not be able to let it go. However, when you are ready to let something go, it is amazing how easy it is to release it.</p>

                            <li>Stand in front of your bathroom mirror.</li>
                            <li>Look into your eyes.</li>
                            <li>Say this affirmation: <em>I love and approve of myself.</em></li>
                            <li>Keep saying it over and over again: <em>I love and approve of myself.</em></li>
                            <li>Repeat this affirmation at least 100 times a day. Yes, that’s right: 100 times. Let <em>I love and approve of myself</em> become your mantra.</li>
                            <li>Each time you pass a mirror or see your reflection, repeat this affirmation.</li>
                        </ol>
                         <p><em>This is an exercise I have given to hundreds and hundreds of people over the years. The results are absolutely phenomenal when people stick with it. Remember: mirror work doesn’t work in theory; it only works in practice. If you do it, it really will make a difference.</em></p>
                         <p><em>If any negative thoughts come up—such as How can I approve of myself when I am fat?, or It’s silly to think that I can think this way, or I am no good—don’t resist them, don’t fight them, don’t judge them. Let them just be there. Stay focused on what you really want to experience, which is to love and approve of yourself. You can gently let go of other thoughts that intrude and stay focused on I love myself and approve of myself.</em></p>
                         <p><em>What we are doing in mirror work is trying to get back to the heart of who we really are. We want to experience who we are when we are not judging ourselves.</em></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Write down some of the ways you don’t love yourself or ways you express your lack of self-worth. Do you criticize your body? Do you talk down to yourself?</li>
                            <li>Write down some of the negative opinions you think others have of you. For each of these negative opinions, write down an affirmation to turn it into a positive statement. For example, you could change <em>My mother thinks I’m fat</em> to <em>I am beautiful exactly as I am.</em></li>
                            <li>Make a list of all the reasons why you love yourself. Make another list of why people love to spend time with you.</li>

                            <li>Go down the list, and beside each item write the date on which you began to criticize yourself for this particular thing. If you can’t remember the exact date, approximate.</li>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 6: I Love and Accept Myself Exactly as I Am</h3>
                         <p>We all have areas of our lives that we think are unacceptable and unlovable. If we are really angry with parts of ourselves, we often engage in self-abuse. We abuse alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes. We overeat. We beat ourselves up emotionally. One of the worst things we do, which causes more damage than anything else, is criticize ourselves. We need to stop all criticism. Once we get into the habit of not criticizing ourselves, it is amazing how we stop criticizing other people. We realize that everyone is a reflection of us, and what we see in another person we can see in ourselves.</p>
                         <p>When we complain about someone, we are really complaining about ourselves. When we can truly love and accept who we are, there is nothing to complain about. We cannot hurt ourselves, and we cannot hurt another person. Let’s make a vow that we will no longer criticize ourselves for anything.</p>

                         <p>We have been going through doors since the moment we were born. That was a big door and a big change, and we have been through many doors since then.</p>
                         <p>We came to this lifetime equipped with everything we need in order to live fully and richly. We have all the wisdom and knowledge we need. We have all the abilities and talents we need. We have all the love we need. Life is here to support us and take care of us. We need to know and trust that this is so.</p>
                         <p>Doors are constantly closing and opening, and if we stay centered in ourselves, then we will always be safe, no matter which doorway we pass through. Even when we pass through the last doorway on this planet, it is not the end. It is simply the beginning of another new adventure. Trust that it is all right to experience change.</p>
                         <p>Today is a new day. We will have many wonderful new experiences. We are loved. We are safe.</p>

                            <li>Find a photo of yourself when you were about five years old. Tape the photo to your bathroom mirror.</li>
                            <li>Look at the photo for a few minutes. What do you see? Do you see a happy child? A miserable child?</li>
                            <li>Talk to your inner child in the mirror. You can look at the photo or even look into your own eyes—whichever feels more comfortable for you. If you had a nickname as a child, use this name as you speak to your inner child. What works really well is to sit in front of the mirror, because if you are standing, as soon as difficult feelings start to come up, you might be tempted to run out the door. So sit down, grab a box of tissues, and start talking.</li>
                            <li>Open your heart and share your innermost thoughts.</li>
                            <li>When you are finished, say these affirmations: <em>I love you, dear one. I am here for you. You are safe.</em></li>

                            <li>Close your eyes and take a few minutes to reflect on what you’ve learned about your inner child.</li>

                         <ol>
                            <li>Go to your bathroom mirror and look at the picture of yourself as a child that you taped to it yesterday.</li>
                            <li>Take a moment right now and tell your inner child that you care. Say these affirmations: <em>I care about you. I love you. I really love you.</em></li>
                            <li>Sit in front of your mirror, if you can, or sit and look into a handheld mirror. Continue the conversation with your inner child that you began yesterday. You could open with an apology, saying something like <em>I’m sorry I haven’t talked to you over the years. I’m sorry I scolded you for so long. I want to make up for all the time we spent apart from each other.</em></li>
                            <li>If you haven’t talked to your inner child in 50 or 60 years, it may take some time before you feel like you’re reconnecting. But be persistent. Eventually you will make a connection. You may feel the child inside you. You may hear the child inside you. You may even see the child inside you.</li>
                            <li>Keep your tissue box nearby. It’s okay to cry while you are talking to your inner child. Tears will help you to break through and connect with the child inside you.</li>

                            <li>When you were little, what did you really like to do? Write down everything that comes to mind. When was the last time you did any of these things? Too often, the parent inside us will stop us from having fun because it’s not the adult thing to do.</li>
                            <li>Now put down your journal and go outside and play with your little child. Have fun! Do the silly things you loved to do when you were young, like jumping in a pile of leaves or running under the garden sprinkler. Watch other children at play. It will bring back memories of the games you enjoyed. If you want more fun in your life, make the connection with your inner child and come from that space of spontaneity. I promise that you will start having more fun.</li>

You are willing to see your behavior and say, “I don’t want to do that anymore.” You know you can become more of who you are. Not become a better person— that would imply that you are not good enough, which isn’t true—but more of who you <em>really</em> are.</p>
                         <p>Growing and changing is exciting, even if you have to look at some painful things within yourself in order to do so.</p>

                            <li>Look deeply into your eyes, and ask yourself these questions: <em>Where did this heartburn come from? What is it trying to tell me? Have I been eating unhealthy foods? Is there something that I am fearful about? Did I hear some news that I’m not able to digest? Is there a heated situation that I’m not dealing with? What or who can’t I stomach?</em></li>
                            <li>Regardless of what pain or dis-ease you are experiencing, you can say these affirmations: <em>I breathe freely and fully. I listen to the messages of my body. I feed my body healthy and nourishing food. I allow my body to rest when needed. I love my amazing body. I am safe. I trust the process of life. I am fearless.</em> Keep repeating the affirmations.</li>
                            <li>Now do some affirmations specifically for the area causing you pain. (You can look up mental patterns for pain and particular illnesses, along with corresponding affirmations, in my book <em>Heal Your Body</em>.) If you’re having stomach problems, for example, you can say: <em>I love my stomach. I really love you, my healthy stomach. I feed you healthy foods, and you digest them with joy. I give you permission to be well.</em></li>
                            <li>Repeat these affirmations two or three more times.</li>

                            <li>When you feel pain or discomfort, take time to quiet yourself. Trust that your Higher Power will let you know what needs to be changed in your life so you can be free of this pain.</li>
                            <li>Visualize a perfect natural setting with your favorite flowers growing in abundance all around you. Feel and smell the sweet, warm air as it blows gently across your face. Concentrate on relaxing every muscle in your body.</li>
                            <li>Ask yourself these questions: <em>How am I contributing to this problem? What is it that I need to know? What areas of my life are in need of change?</em> Meditate on these questions and let the answers arise. Write down the answers in your journal.</li>
                            <li>Choose one of the answers you received in Step 3 and write an action plan that you can work on today.</li>
                        </ol>
                         <p><em>Make changes one step at a time. As the Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu said, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” One small step added to another can create significant change in your life. Pain does not necessarily disappear overnight, though it may. It has taken time for pain to surface; therefore it may take some time to recognize that it is no longer needed. Be gentle with yourself.</em></p>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 10: I Listen Carefully to My Body’s Messages</h3>
                         <p>The body, like everything else in life, is a mirror of your inner thoughts and beliefs. Every cell responds to every single thought you think and every word you speak.</p>
                         <p>In this world of change, you choose to be flexible in all areas. You are willing to change yourself and your beliefs to improve the quality of your life and your world. Your body loves you in spite of how you may treat it. Your body communicates with you, and you now listen to its messages. You are willing to get the message.</p>
                         <p>You pay attention and make the necessary corrections. You love your body and give it what it needs on every level to bring it back to optimal health. You call upon an inner strength that is yours whenever you need it.</p>

                         <ol>
                            <li>Find a place with a mirror where you will feel safe and will not be disturbed.</li>
                            <li>Look into your eyes in the mirror. If you are still uncomfortable doing this, then concentrate on your mouth or nose.</li>
                            <li>See yourself and/or the person you believe has wronged you. Remember the moment when you became angry and let yourself feel the anger come through you. Begin to tell this person exactly what you are so angry about. Express all the anger you feel. Be specific. You could say something like: <em>I am angry at you because [fill in the reason]. I am hurt because you [fill in the reason]. I am so afraid because you [fill in the reason].</em></li>
                            <li>You may need to do this exercise several times before you truly feel that you have gotten rid of all your anger. You may want to work on one anger issue or several. Do what feels right for you.</li>

                        <h3>The Power Is Within You: Your Day 11 Journaling Exercise</h3>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Have you been angry for much of your life? Here are some questions you can journal about to help release these habitual angry feelings: <em>Why am I choosing to be angry all the time? What am I doing to create situation after situation that angers me? Who am I still punishing? What am I giving out that attracts in others the need to irritate me?</em></li>
                            <li>Now ask yourself these questions and write down your answers: <em>What do I want? What makes me happy? What can I do to make myself happy?</em></li>
                            <li>Think about ways you can create a new space inside you to feel good about yourself. Think about ways you can create optimistic and cheerful patterns and beliefs.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 11: I Deserve to Feel Good</h3>
                         <p>Life is very simple. We create our experiences by our patterns of thought and feeling. What we believe about ourselves and about life becomes true for us. Thoughts are only words strung together. They have no meaning whatsoever. It is we who give meaning to them. We give meaning to them by focusing on the negative messages over and over in our minds.</p>
                         <p>What we do with our feelings is very important. Are we going to act them out? Will we punish others? Sadness, loneliness, guilt, anger, and fear are all normal emotions. But when these feelings take over and become predominant, life can be an emotional battlefield.</p>
                         <p>Through mirror work, self-love, and positive affirmations, you can nourish yourself and relieve any of the anxiety you may be feeling at the moment. Do you believe you deserve peace and serenity in your emotional life?</p>
                         <p>Let’s affirm: <em>I release the pattern in my consciousness that is creating resistance to my good. I deserve to feel good.</em></p>

                         <h3>Your Day 12 Mirror Work Exercise</h3>
                         <ol>
                            <li>What is the greatest fear you are experiencing now? Write it on a Post-it® note and stick the note on the left side of your mirror. Acknowledge this fear. Tell it: <em>I know you want to protect me. I appreciate that you want to help me. I thank you. Now I let you go. I release you and I am safe.</em> Then take the sticky note, rip it up, and toss it in the trash or flush it down the toilet. However you get rid of the fear, the point is to release it.</li>
                            <li>Look in the mirror again and repeat these affirmations: <em>I love and trust. Love and life take care of me. I am one with the Power that created me. I am safe. All is well in my world.</em></li>
                            <li>Now look in the mirror and observe your breathing. We often hold our breath when we’re frightened. If you are feeling threatened or fearful, consciously breathe. Take a few deep breaths. Breathing opens the space inside you that is your power. It straightens your spine, opens your chest, and gives your tender heart room to expand.</li>
                            <li>Continue breathing naturally and observing your breath. As you do this, repeat these affirmations: <em>I love you, [Name]. I love you. I really love you. I trust life. Life gives me everything I need. There is nothing to fear. I am safe. All is well.</em></li>
                        </ol>

                         <ol>
                            <li>Write down your greatest fears under the following headings: Family, Health, Career, Relationships, and Finances.</li>
                            <li>Then write one or more positive affirmations for each fear you listed. For example, if you wrote <em>I’m afraid I’ll get sick and won’t be able to take care of myself</em>, then an affirmation might be <em>I will always attract all the help I need.</em></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 12: I Am Always Perfectly Protected</h3>
                         <p>Remember: when a fearful thought comes up, it is just trying to protect you. Tell the fear, “I appreciate that you want to help me.” Follow that with an affirmation to address that particular fear. Acknowledge and thank the fear, but don’t give it power or importance.</p>

                         <p>As you move forward, see yourself opening doors on wonderful experiences you would like to have. See yourself opening doors to joy, peace, healing, prosperity, and love. Doors to understanding, compassion, and forgiveness. Doors to freedom. Doors to self-worth and self-esteem. Doors to self-love. It is all here before you. Which door will you open first?</p>
                         <p>Trust that your inner guide is leading you in the ways that are best for you and that your spiritual growth is continuously expanding. No matter which door opens or which door closes, you are always safe.</p>

No longer listen to or become part of detrimental thoughts or conversations. Today no one can harm you because you refuse to believe in being hurt.

Destructive thoughts have no power over you.</p>
                         <p>You think and say only what you want to create in your life. You are more than adequate for all you need to do. You are one with the Power that created you. You are safe. All is well in your world.</p>

                        <h3>Your Day 15 Mirror Work Exercise</h3>
                         <p>I believe you receive the most benefit from forgiveness work when you do it in front of a mirror. I suggest finding a mirror you can sit in front of comfortably. I like to use the long mirror on the back of my bedroom door. Give yourself time to do this exercise. And you will probably want to repeat it often. Most of us have a lot of people to forgive.</p>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Sit in front of your mirror and close your eyes. Breathe deeply several times. Feel yourself grounded on your chair.</li>
                            <li>Think of the many people who have hurt you in your life. Let them pass through your mind. Now open your eyes and begin to talk to one of them—aloud. Say something like “You hurt me deeply. I thought I would never get past this. However, I will not stay stuck in the past any longer. I am willing to forgive you.” If you can’t do that yet, just affirm, <em>I am willing</em>. Your willingness is all it takes to move toward forgiveness.</li>
                            <li>Take a breath and then say to the person, “I forgive you. I set you free.” Breathe again and say, “You are free. I am free.”</li>
                            <li>Notice how you feel. You may feel resistance or you may feel relief. If you feel resistance, just breathe and affirm: <em>I am willing to release all resistance.</em></li>
                            <li>As you continue to do this exercise, today or another day, expand your list of people to forgive. Remember: forgiveness is not an event; it’s a process. You may need to keep working on one person a little longer, each time going a little deeper into forgiveness.</li>
                        </ol>
                         <p><em>This may be a day when you can forgive several people. It may be a day when you can forgive only one. It doesn’t matter. However you do this exercise is the right way for you. The universe and forgiveness see your showing up. At times forgiveness is like peeling away the layers of an onion. If there are too many layers, put the onion away for a day or so. You can always come back and peel another layer. Acknowledge yourself for even being willing to do this exercise. You are healing.</em></p>

                        <h3>The Power Is Within You: Your Day 15 Journaling Exercise</h3>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Put on some soft music—something that will make you feel relaxed and peaceful. Now take your journal and a pen, and let your mind drift.</li>
                            <li>Go back into the past and think of all the things that you’re angry with yourself about. Write them down. Write them all down. You may discover that you have never forgiven yourself for the humiliation of wetting your pants in the first grade. What a long time to carry that burden!</li>
                            <li>Now take this list and write a positive affirmation for each item. If you wrote <em>I’ll never forgive myself for [incident]</em>, then your affirmation could be: <em>This is a new moment. I am free to let go.</em> Remember that sometimes it’s easier to forgive others than to forgive yourself. Often we demand perfection of ourselves and are harder on ourselves than on others. However, it’s time to go beyond this old attitude. Forgive yourself. Let it go. Give yourself the space to be spontaneous and free.</li>
                            <li>And now put down your journal and go outside—to a beach, a park, even an empty lot—and let yourself run. Don’t jog; run— wild and free. Do somersaults. Skip along the street and laugh while you’re doing it! Take your inner child outdoors with you and have some fun. So what if someone sees you? This is for your freedom!</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 15: I Can Forgive</h3>
                         <p>I am one with life, and life loves me and supports me. Therefore, I claim for myself an open heart filled with love. We are all doing the best we can at any given moment, and this is also true for me. The past is over and done. I am not my parents or their patterns of resentment. I am my own unique self, and I choose to open my heart and allow love, compassion, and understanding to flush out all memories of past pain. I am free to be all that I can be. This is the truth of my being, and I accept it as so. All is well in my life.</p>

                            <li>Write ten affirmations of love and practice them in front of your mirror. Here are some examples: <em>I am worthy of love. The more I open to love, the safer I am. Today I remember that life loves me. I let love find me at the perfect time.</em></li>
                            <li>Write down ten things that you love to do. Pick five and do them today.</li>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 16: I Live in a Circle of Love</h3>
                         <p>Envelop your family in a circle of love, whether family members are living or not. Broaden the circle to include your friends, your loved ones, your co-workers, everyone from your past, and all the people you would like to forgive but don’t know how. Affirm that you have wonderful, harmonious relationships with them all, with respect and caring on both sides.</p>
                         <p>Know that you can live with dignity and peace and joy. Let this circle of love envelop the entire planet, and let your heart open so that you have space within you for unconditional love.</p>

                         <ol>
                            <li>For this exercise, I’d like you to start by sitting in a comfortable chair with your hands in your lap and both feet flat on the floor. Now close your eyes and take three long, deep breaths. Breathe in slowly and breathe out. Breathe in and breathe out. Imagine that you are wearing your tension and fear as an overcoat. Imagine undoing the buttons and pulling the coat off your shoulders, sliding it over your arms, and dropping it on the floor. Feel any fear and tension flowing out of your body. Feel your muscles relax. Allow your entire body to relax.</li>
                            <li>Now pick up your pocket mirror and look deeply into your eyes. Say: <em>I release all fear. I let go of all tension. I am at peace. Freedom from stress is my divine right.</em> Keep repeating these affirmations over and over again.</li>
                            <li>Close your eyes and take a few more minutes to breathe deeply. Repeat these affirmations: <em>I believe in ME. I am a capable person. I can do it. I can handle anything that comes my way. I believe in possibilities.</em></li>
                            <li>Anytime you see your reflection today, repeat these affirmations: <em>I am at peace. I have all the time I need. I flow with life easily and ef ortlessly.</em></li>
                        </ol>

                         <ol>
                            <li>Close your eyes and drift back to your past. See yourself when you were five years old. Where are you? At school? At home? What do you like to do? How do you view the world? Open your eyes and write down whatever comes to mind.</li>
                            <li>Do you remember any of the worries or negative beliefs that you had when you were five years old? Do you remember any hurt feelings? Write them all down.</li>
                            <li>Next to all the beliefs you wrote down in Step 2, write down the real reasons for these beliefs. Perhaps your parents were having a bad day at work and told you something that wasn’t true. Perhaps a childhood friend who was unloved decided to take it out on you. Write all your thoughts in your journal.</li>
                            <li>Make a list of some of the things that are causing you stress this week. Do any of them have to do with the limited thinking of your five-year-old consciousness? Take time to write down your innermost thoughts and reflections.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 17: I Experience the Totality of Possibilities Within Me</h3>
                         <p>What does the <em>totality of possibilities</em> mean to you? Think of it as going beyond all limitations. Let your mind go beyond thoughts like <em>It can’t be done. It won’t work. There’s not enough time. There are too many obstacles.</em></p>
                         <p>Think of how often you have expressed these limitations: <em>Because I’m a woman, I can’t do this. Because I’m a man, I can’t do that. I don’t have what it takes.</em> You hold on to limitations because they are important to you. But limitations stop you from expressing and experiencing the totality of possibilities. Every time you think <em>I can’t</em>, you are limiting yourself. Are you willing to go beyond what you believe today?</p>

Everything I could possibly need is already here waiting for me. This planet has more food on it than I could possibly eat. There is more money than I could ever spend. There are more people than I could ever meet. There is more love than I could possibly experience. There is more joy than I can even imagine. This world has everything I need and desire. It is all mine to use and to have.</p>
                        <p>The One Infinite Mind, the One Infinite Intelligence, always says yes to me. No matter what I choose to believe or think or say, the Universe always says yes. I do not waste my time on negative thinking or negative subjects. I choose to see myself and life in the most positive ways.</p>
                        <p>I say Yes! to opportunity and prosperity. I say Yes! to all good. I am a Yes! person living in a Yes! world, being responded to by a Yes! Universe, and I rejoice that this is so.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful to be one with Universal Wisdom and backed by Universal Power.</p>

                           <li>Read inspiring stories about the power of gratitude. (My book <em>Gratitude: A Way of Life</em> contains contributions from 48 of the most inspiring people I know, and you can also find stories in <em>An Attitude of Gratitude: 21 Life Lessons</em> by Keith D.

                       <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 19: I Give and Receive Gifts Graciously</h3>
                        <p>Deep at the center of my being, there is an infinite well of gratitude. I now allow this gratitude to fill my heart, my body, my mind, my consciousness, my very being. This gratitude radiates out from me in all directions, touching everything in my world, and returns to me as more to be grateful for. The more gratitude I feel, the more aware I am that the supply is endless.</p>
                        <p>Appreciation and acceptance act like powerful magnets for miracles every moment of the day. Compliments are gifts of prosperity. I have learned to accept them graciously. If somebody compliments me, I smile and say, “Thank you.”</p>
                        <p>Today is a sacred gift from life. I open my arms wide to receive the full measure of prosperity that the Universe offers. Any time of the day or night, I can let it in.</p>
                        <p>The Universe supports me in every way possible. I live in a loving, abundant, harmonious Universe, and I am grateful. There are times in life, however, when the Universe gives to me but I am not in a position to do anything about giving back. I can think of many people who helped me enormously at times when there was no way I could ever repay them. Later, however, I was able to help others, and that’s the way life goes. I relax and rejoice in the abundance and gratitude that are here now.</p>

                        <ol>
                           <li>I would like you to watch a video of a sweet little girl doing her affirmations. It’s called “Jessica’s ‘Daily Affirmation,’” and you can see it at www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR3rK0kZFkg.</li>
                           <li>Watch this video with your child or any child in your life, even with your inner child.</li>
                           <li>Ask your child to do its own daily affirmations just as Jessica did in the video. Ask the child what it is happy about and have it tell that to the mirror.</li>
                           <li>You can start this exercise by doing your own mirror work and inviting your child to join in. Say simple affirmations like: <em>I love you. I love everything about you. I am great! I am beautiful! I have cool hair! I can dance like a TV star!</em></li>
                           <li>Schedule a time every day to do mirror work with your child, even if only for a few minutes in the morning.</li>

                        <ol>
                           <li>Begin today’s journaling exercise by reading a story excerpted from my book <em>The Adventures of Lulu</em>. You can access it by visiting www.louisehay.com/learning-mirror-work.</li>
                           <li>Have drawing paper, colored pencils, colored markers, crayons, and glue ready, and ask your child to draw a Magic Mirror to go to, just as Lulu does in the book. Encourage the child to decorate the mirror: glue pretty pictures around it, add glitter and sparkles to the frame, cover it in a riot of color.</li>
                           <li>With your child, take turns looking in the Magic Mirror and saying wonderful things about yourself.</li>
                           <li>Write down the positive statements you and your child say, so you can repeat them when you do your morning mirror work together.</li>

                       <h3>Your Heart Thought for Day 20: I Communicate Openly with My Children</h3>
                        <p>It is vitally important to keep the lines of communication open with children, especially during the teen years. So often children are told things like <em>Don’t say that. Don’t do that. Don’t feel that. Don’t be that way. Don’t express that.</em> When all they hear is don’t, don’t, don’t, they stop communicating.</p>
                        <p>Then, when the children are older, parents complain, “My children never call me.” Why don’t they call? Because the lines of communication have been cut, that’s why.</p>
                        <p>When you are open with your children—using positive statements like “It’s okay to feel sad” and “You can talk to me about it”—and you encourage them to share their feelings, the lines of communication will be restored.</p>
